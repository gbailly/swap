Execution

First of all, to run the application locally, you should have Node.JS (at least version 0.8.1) installed on your machine.

Then you can proceed with the following steps:

1. Uncompress the downloaded folder (if not already done) and enter it (using a terminal).

2. Enter the following command to fetch the required modules: ```npm install jade express ejs xmldom```.

3. Now you can run the server by entering ```node swap.js```.

4. You are ready to start playing with the tool on port 5000.
